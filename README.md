Contact-based clustering for protein structures
============================================

Open-source package that implements a fast clustering algorithm for protein
structures based on a contact-based similarity metric.

Advantages over traditional RMSD-based clustering methods include:
- Does not require alignments.
- As a result, it is usually much faster.
- Multi-resolution clustering: atom-atom contacts, residue-residue, chain-chain, ...
- Works for any molecule you can encode in a PDB/mmCIF format.
